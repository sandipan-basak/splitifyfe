Usage in Ant Design
To use these colors in your Ant Design project, you can customize your theme settings as described in the Ant Design documentation on theme customization. You would typically modify the @primary-color, @success-color, @warning-color, @error-color, @font-size-base, and other variables in your project's Less file to match the colors from your palette.

Please note that colors might appear differently on different screens and under different lighting conditions. It's always a good practice to test your color palette under various conditions to ensure it works well for your users. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification.
